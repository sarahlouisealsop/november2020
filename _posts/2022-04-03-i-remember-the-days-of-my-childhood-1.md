I remember the days of my childhood
I remember them fondly
I remember fireworks every year 
And I remember walks in the park

I remember talking for hours at sleepovers


I remember starting new schools

I remember trying to work out who I was 

And I remember never really finding the answer

I remember being cold
I remember always wearing thick socks at home
I remember hand me down jumpers from other families
And I remember always being wrapped in a duvet

I remember being hungry
I remember going to my Nans house exactly at dinner time
I remember my mother only eating what we did not
And I remember wondering why

I remember when we ran out of hot water
I remember boiling a kettle and using that to wash
I remember mother making it a game
And I remember shivering in a towel

I remember when the lights would go out
I remember lighting candles to read
I remember wondering why power cuts were so regular
And I remember working it out

I remember Â£5 plimsolls 
I remember holes in my shoes
I remember second hand school uniform
And I remember how everyone else's was new

I remember thinking this was normal
I remember working out it was not
I remember asking my mother why
And I remember the look on her face
