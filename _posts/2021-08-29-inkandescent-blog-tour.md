As part of my PR Internship with [Inkandescent](https://www.inkandescent.co.uk/), I had the fantastic opportunity to run their blog tour for their publication of [Mainstream](https://www.inkandescent.co.uk/mainstream).

*'Mainstream brings thirty authors in from the margins to occupy centre-page. Queer storytellers. Working class wordsmiths. Chroniclers of colour. Writers whose life experiences give unique perspectives on universal challenges, whose voices must be heard.'*
